# Bluetooth Controlled RC Car
I have built a Bluetooth Controlled 4-Wheel Car using Arduino

## Hardware Components
- Arduino UNO
- L293D Motor Driver Shield
- HC-05 Bluetooth Module
- 4 DC Motors with Wheels
- Chassis
- 2 18650 3.7V Li-ion batteries
- Rocker switch

## Andriod App
- Build the App using MIT App Invertor

## How It Works
- The HC-05 module receives commands from the Android app via Bluetooth.
- Arduino interprets the signals and drives motors accordingly via the L293D motor shield.
